# RigidFibersGPU

## Extensions

- Visualization
- Periodicity
- Brownian motion

# Optimizations

- Reusing Gmat in velocity update
- Matrix symmetry?


## Open questions?

- OpenCL vs CUDA? -> OpenCL
- Library for solver? -> ViennaCL, clMAGMA
- Eq 24,25 missing 1/2 and 3/2?


## Closed question

    Q: External force, only gravity? Why different for each fiber?
    A: Yes, for now only gravity. Does not have to be different for each fiber

    Q: Equation 20, where is term 3/2(M...)?
    A: See page 8 -> All external torques are zero

    Q: BVector numeric stability?
    A: Non issue, was bug in Gmat calulation
